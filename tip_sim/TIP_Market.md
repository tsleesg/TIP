# Estimating the Upper Limit of TIP Token Market Capitalisation

To estimate the upper limit of the market capitalisation (market cap) for the TIP token, we need to consider its unique setup: TIP is paired with 1000 different tokens in liquidity pools, where each pool operates as a fixed-rate concentrated liquidity market maker (CLMM). Each pair, such as TIP-XYZ, has multiple pools with increasingly expensive TIP (requiring more XYZ per TIP), and all pools start with an initial asymmetric lock of 100% TIP and 0% of the counterparty token. The only way to acquire TIP is by swapping the counterparty token into these pools at their specified fixed rates. Additionally, locked liquidity can be purchased back through the pools, and a price drop in a counterparty token encourages more inflow into TIP, exerting upward pressure on TIP's price. Our goal is to determine the maximum possible market cap of TIP in a stable average state.

## Understanding Market Capitalisation

Market cap is defined as:

Market Cap of TIP = Total Supply of TIP × Price of TIP

Let's denote the total supply of TIP as $S_{TIP,total}$ and its price in USD as $P_{TIP/USD}$, so:

$M_{TIP} = S_{TIP,total} \times P_{TIP/USD}$

The query doesn't provide these values directly, so we must infer them from the system's structure, assuming each of the 1000 counterparty tokens has the same stable average market cap, denoted $(M)$, in USD.

## Modeling the Liquidity Pool System

### Pool Structure

TIP is paired with 1000 unique tokens, say $Q_1, Q_2, ..., Q_{1000}$. For each token $Q_i$, there are multiple pools with TIP, each offering TIP at a fixed exchange rate that increases across the tiers (more $Q_i$ per TIP). Initially, each pool is seeded with some amount of TIP but no $Q_i$, meaning:

At $t = 0$, reserves are $R_{TIP,i,j}$ (TIP in pool $(j)$ of pair TIP-$Q_i$) and $R_{Q_i,j} = 0$.

To acquire TIP, users swap $Q_i$ into a pool at its fixed rate. For pool $(j)$ of pair TIP-$Q_i$, let the fixed rate be $k_{i,j}$, where:

$P_{TIP/Q_i,j} = k_{i,j}$

This means 1 TIP costs $k_{i,j}$ units of $Q_i$. As users swap $Q_i$ in, the pool accumulates $R_{Q_i,j}$, and TIP is withdrawn, reducing $R_{TIP,i,j}$. The "fixed-rate" nature suggests that within each pool, the exchange rate remains constant, unlike traditional AMMs where the price shifts with reserve ratios. This could imply a design where each pool has a finite TIP reserve at a specific price point, and once exhausted, trading moves to the next (more expensive) pool.

### Multiple Pools per Pair

For each $Q_i$, pools are ordered with increasing rates: $k_{i,1} < k_{i,2} < k_{i,3} < ...$. The cheapest pool (e.g., pool 1 with rate $k_{i,1}$) is used first. Since anyone buying TIP at $k_{i,1}$ can swap it back at the same rate (assuming reversibility), there's no incentive to create a cheaper pool. Traders buy at the lowest available rate and may sell at a higher rate in another pool, arbitraging the fixed-rate differences. In a stable state, we assume trading has occurred, and each pool has some $R_{TIP,i,j}$ and $R_{Q_i,j}$.

### Initial TIP Distribution

Since all pools start with 100% TIP and 0% $Q_i$, the total supply of TIP, $S_{TIP,total}$, is initially locked across all pools for all 1000 tokens. Let's assume there are $(n)$ pools per pair TIP-$Q_i$, so there are $1000 \times n$ pools total. The initial TIP locked in pool $(j)$ of pair $(i)$ is $R_{TIP,i,j}(t=0)$, and:

$S_{TIP,total} = \sum_{i=1}^{1000} \sum_{j=1}^{n} R_{TIP,i,j}(t=0)$

In a stable state, some TIP has been swapped out, and $Q_i$ has been deposited.

### Price Determination

The price of TIP in USD depends on the pool where trading occurs. For pool $(j)$ of pair TIP-$Q_i$:

$P_{TIP/USD} = P_{TIP/Q_i,j} \times P_{Q_i/USD} = k_{i,j} \times P_{Q_i/USD}$

Each $Q_i$ has market cap $M = S_{Q_i,total} \times P_{Q_i/USD}$, where $S_{Q_i,total}$ is its total supply, so:

$P_{Q_i/USD} = \frac{M}{S_{Q_i,total}}$

Thus:

$P_{TIP/USD} = k_{i,j} \times \frac{M}{S_{Q_i,total}}$

In a stable state, TIP's price should be consistent across all pairs due to arbitrage (e.g., swapping $Q_1$ for TIP in one pool and TIP for $Q_2$ in another). However, with multiple fixed-rate pools per pair, TIP's effective price depends on the marginal pool—the cheapest pool with available TIP. Let's denote the lowest active rate for pair $(i)$ as $k_{i,min}$, so:

$P_{TIP/USD} \approx k_{i,min} \times \frac{M}{S_{Q_i,total}}$

## Total Value Locked and TIP's Market Cap

### TIP Locked in Pools

Define $(P)$ (where $0 < P \leq 1$) as the fraction of $S_{TIP,total}$ remaining locked in all pools in the stable state:

$S_{TIP,locked} = P \times S_{TIP,total}$

This is spread across $1000 \times n$ pools. For simplicity, assume TIP is distributed such that each pair TIP-$Q_i$ has an effective pool representing its $(n)$ pools, and TIP is equally allocated across the 1000 pairs:

$R_{TIP,i} = \frac{S_{TIP,locked}}{1000} = \frac{P \times S_{TIP,total}}{1000}$

(This aggregates the remaining TIP across all $(n)$ pools per pair.)

### Value in Each Pair

For pair $(i)$, the value locked is:

$V_i = R_{TIP,i} \times P_{TIP/USD} + R_{Q_i} \times P_{Q_i/USD}$

Where $R_{Q_i} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} R_{Q_i,j}$ is the total $Q_i$ deposited. Since $R_{Q_i}$ is swapped in at fixed rates, and TIP is withdrawn, we relate reserves via the swap history. However, in a fixed-rate pool, value isn't necessarily balanced like in constant-product AMMs. Instead, the value depends on the TIP price and $Q_i$ accumulated.

Total value locked:

$V_{total} = \sum_{i=1}^{1000} V_i$

### Relating $Q_i$ Locked to Market Cap

Assume a fraction $(f)$ (where $0 < f \leq 1$) of $Q_i$'s supply is locked across its $(n)$ pools:

$R_{Q_i} = f \times S_{Q_i,total}$

Value of $Q_i$ locked:

$R_{Q_i} \times P_{Q_i/USD} = f \times S_{Q_i,total} \times \frac{M}{S_{Q_i,total}} = f \times M$

Total value locked from all $Q_i$:

$V_{total,Q} = \sum_{i=1}^{1000} f \times M = 1000 \times f \times M$

Value of TIP locked:

$V_{total,TIP} = S_{TIP,locked} \times P_{TIP/USD} = P \times S_{TIP,total} \times P_{TIP/USD} = P \times M_{TIP}$

$V_{total} = V_{total,TIP} + V_{total,Q} = P \times M_{TIP} + 1000 \times f \times M$

## Upper-Limit Estimation

To maximise $M_{TIP}$, we need $P_{TIP/USD}$ and relate $V_{total}$ to $(M)$. In the stable state, TIP's price is set by the marginal pool. The mechanism where a $Q_i$ price drop increases inflow suggests TIP's price rises as $P_{Q_i/USD}$ falls, but we assume a stable $(M)$. Let's hypothesise that TIP's market cap could approach the total market cap of all 1000 tokens ($(1000M)$) due to its central role.

From the pools:

$R_{Q_i} \times k_{i,j} = \text{TIP withdrawn from pool } j$

Total TIP remaining is $S_{TIP,locked}$, and the price is high if most TIP is in expensive pools. For an upper limit, assume:

$f = 1$ (all $Q_i$ locked, though unrealistic),
$P = 1$ (all TIP still locked, implying minimal withdrawals),
$P_{TIP/USD}$ is maximised at the highest rates.

However, if all TIP and $Q_i$ are locked, circulating supply is zero, which isn't practical. Realistically, $(f)$ and $(P)$ are less than 1. Let's test:

$M_{TIP} = \frac{V_{total} - 1000 \times f \times M}{P}$

If $V_{total} \approx 1000 \times f \times M + P \times M_{TIP}$, and we maximise $P_{TIP/USD}$, then in an extreme case where TIP captures all value:

$M_{TIP} \approx 1000 \times M$

This assumes TIP's price scales with the aggregate liquidity of 1000 tokens, each contributing up to $(M)$ via swaps.

## Final Estimate

Considering the fixed-rate structure, the ability to purchase back liquidity, and TIP's stabilizing role, the upper limit occurs when TIP's market cap reflects the total value of the paired ecosystem. Thus:

**Market Cap of TIP ≈ 1000M**

This represents the theoretical maximum in a stable state, aligning with TIP's potential dominance across 1000 pairs, each with market cap $(M)$.
